You need to accept this question as an assignment on github. Follow the instructions on course webpage i.e. from :ref:`introduction page<intro>`.

Write a bash script to take an integer array of any length as an argument. Arguments should
be space separated as shown below. Your script ‘q2.sh’ should be able to display the length
of the array in the first line and sum of the cubes of each number in the second line. There
should be only two lines output, no space, no extra characters.

Ex. : To execute the script:

>>./lab_q2.sh 1 2 3 4 5

Output

>>5

>>225

Explanation : 1 3 +2 3 +3 3 +4 3 +5 3 = 225
